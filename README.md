## 🚀 About Me

I have 5+ years of experience building and maintaining backend systems across enterprise platforms, event systems, analytics dashboards, subscription services, and mobile-integrated applications.

My core focus is backend engineering using Golang, PHP, Java, .NET, and Node.js with microservices architecture, event-driven communication, and payment integrations.

I don’t just build CRUD APIs — I design data flows, stabilize legacy systems, integrate third-party services, and ensure systems survive real production workloads.
